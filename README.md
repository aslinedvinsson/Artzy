# Artzy
screenshot am i responsive

Artzy is a distinctive e-commerce platform developed as a part of Portfolio Project 5 for the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Developer Course. Utilizing Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, Artzy dismantles the barriers to art appreciation, offering an extensive array of paintings and prints accessible to everyone, irrespective of their art knowledge.

With a focus on emotional resonance rather than academic credentials, Artzy curates art that speaks directly to the heart. It is founded on the belief that art should be a source of joy and inspiration for all, fostering a connection between the viewer and the artwork without necessitating expertise.

The vision behind Artzy extends beyond merely selling art; it's about encouraging mindful engagement with art, supporting a lifestyle where beauty, creativity, and personal expression are paramount. This approach is in line with modern values of meaningful consumption and the growing desire for experiences that truly enrich lives.

In essence, Artzy is not just a platform; it's a movement toward making art accessible and enjoyable for everyone, promoting a deeper, more personal interaction with the world of art.

# Project Rationale - Bridging the Art Appreciation Gap
Artzy was created to bridge the gap between the art community and those who feel intimidated by their limited knowledge of art. It aims to make art appreciation and acquisition more accessible to everyone through an easy-to-use e-commerce platform.

## Purpose and Goal: Mission to Simplify Art Discovery and Ownership
Artzy's mission is to simplify the process of discovering and purchasing art, making it welcoming for everyone, regardless of their art background. The platform offers a wide range of paintings and prints to foster emotional connections between individuals and art, encouraging exploration and expression through art ownership.

## Target Audience: Who Artzy Serves - Connecting with Our Audience
Artzy serves art enthusiasts, gift shoppers, and decorators who are overwhelmed by traditional art purchasing processes. It targets those looking to enhance their personal spaces, find unique gifts, or embark on an art discovery journey.

## Addressing Target Audience Needs: A Tailored Approach to Meeting Our Audience's Needs
Artzy offers an intuitive platform with features such as detailed art descriptions and emotion-based recommendations, making art selection more informative and less intimidating. It strives to create a welcoming space for art lovers of all levels by tailoring the platform’s services to meet the diverse needs and preferences of its users.

## Business Model and Customer Goals: Accessibility at Scale and Enhancing Customer Experience through Art
Artzy operates as a B2C e-commerce platform dedicated to democratizing access to art. The platform is scalable and user-friendly, featuring a diverse collection to suit various tastes. With a digital-first marketing strategy, including social media and newsletters, Artzy engages with its community and promotes new art pieces. Its business model emphasizes a seamless shopping experience, ensuring customer satisfaction and fostering a culture of art appreciation among a broad audience.

## SEO Strategies
To maximize SEO for Artzy, I conduct research on specific, relevant keywords that potential customers might use when searching for art online. This involves using tools like Google Trends and Keyword Planner to identify terms related to popular art styles, mediums (e.g., paintings, prints), and broader art-related queries. The aim is to strike a balance between high-traffic keywords and those with lower competition to attract both broad and niche audiences. Incorporating these keywords naturally into the site content, metadata, and newsletters enhances Artzy's online visibility and search engine ranking.
I employ different meta titles and descriptions on various pages to improve SEO, providing search engines and potential visitors with a concise summary of the page’s content.

## Sitemap.xml
Adding a sitemap.xml to Artzy aids search engines in quickly finding and indexing the pages, thereby improving the site's visibility and SEO, leading to increased traffic. The sitemap.xml acts as a roadmap of the website, listing all important pages and content. This facilitates easier discovery, indexing, and understanding of the site’s structure and content hierarchy by search engine crawlers, enhancing SEO by ensuring all art collections and related content are found and ranked appropriately, ultimately driving more organic traffic to Artzy.

## Robots.txt
Utilizing a robots.txt file for Artzy directs search engine bots on which pages to crawl and index, improving site navigation and SEO efficiency. The file serves as a directive for search engine bots, specifying which areas of the site should be crawled and which should be ignored. By managing bot traffic, I ensure the indexing of key pages and prevent server overload from unnecessary crawling. This not only improves Artzy’s SEO by ensuring relevant content is quickly found and indexed but also enhances the overall user experience by highlighting the most important content.


## Agile
This project followes agile methods. I identified Epics and broke them down to user stories to map out what needs the customer and seller have. For every user story there are Acceptance criteria that needs to be met and in some cases more concrete tasks. The userstories are sorted with the use of the MoSCoW method, giving the userstories labels like "Must Have", "Should Have", "Could Have" and "Wount have". Git Hub projects is used to document it and track the progress of the deveoplment. The Epics and User stories are divided into to Milestone. The first one is Requirements Specification and Analysis, Technical set up and Design and the second one is Interface and user experience including CRUD functionality, search and sort.

The Epics and User stories are documented on a Kanban board on Git Hub and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/aslinedvinsson/projects/8/views/1)

## Work approaach
This project originated from a template provided by a Code Institute project called Boutique Ado. After implementing all the features from Boutique Ado, I transitioned the project into a unique creation of my own. I modified aspects of the front end and introduced new features to the back end. For much of the design work, I utilized Bootstrap.

## Marketing strategies
To effectively market Artzy, the art e-commerce platform, I will employ a multi-faceted strategy designed to engage our target audience and enhance our online presence.

### Content Marketing
We will develop newsletters and social media content that educates and inspires our audience about art. By focusing on storytelling, we aim to highlight artists and their work, making art more relatable and accessible to everyone.

### SEO
We will optimize the website with relevant keywords identified through research. This will improve our visibility in search engine results and attract organic traffic from individuals interested in purchasing art.

### Social Media Engagement
We will utilize platforms like Instagram and Facebook, where visual content thrives, to showcase our art pieces. Creating engaging posts and connecting with our audience through comments and stories will be key.

#### Facebook
//////// Include a mockup of a Facebook post or page here.

### Email Marketing
We will launch an email newsletter to keep subscribers informed about new arrivals, exclusive offers, and upcoming sales. This strategy is intended to encourage repeat visits and foster a community around the brand.


# UI/UX Design
Artzy e-commerce platform is a vibrant gateway to creativity, featuring an inspiring homepage alive with color, designed to captivate and draw art lovers into a world of visual delight. With a minimalist approach, I’ve chosen a white background for browsing art, ensuring each piece stands out with its true colors and details, offering a clean and focused viewing experience akin to an exclusive gallery.

Navigation on my site is intentionally streamlined and intuitive, allowing you to explore curated collections effortlessly. The visual design emphasizes a user-friendly interface, highlighting simplicity and ease, making the discovery and acquisition of art an enjoyable and straightforward journey for every visitor.

By focusing on a clean, engaging, and easy-to-navigate experience, I aim to enrich the art buying process, turning it into a journey of discovery and inspiration for all who visit.

## Colors
Choosing a vibrant and colorful image for the homepage against a white background with black text is a strategic move designed to instantly grab the visitor's attention. This pop of color makes a bold statement, ensuring the artwork and, by extension, the products, are the stars of the show.

The contrasting white header and black footer enhance readability and frame the homepage art beautifully, without overshadowing the main attraction. On subsequent pages, the white background with black text continues this theme of simplicity and focus, ensuring that the colorful homepage art remains the visual highlight of the website.

This color scheme is not just about aesthetics; it's a deliberate choice to make the shopping experience more engaging and memorable. By keeping the design elements minimal and focused, the website directs visitors' attention exactly where it needs to be: on the products and the vibrant imagery that represents them. This approach not only improves user engagement but also strengthens the site's branding.
